# Simple Three js Example
Three.js is a JavaScript library that uses WebGL in an HTML5 canvas to render animations that alone are not possible to create in WebGL. This library is responsible for creating lighting effects, shadows, materials, textures, and 3D geometrical models, which are very hard to create in WebGL.
